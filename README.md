# Django Stopwatch

A fully responsive stopwatch web application built using **Django** for the backend and **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap** for the frontend. The stopwatch displays the time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds and includes essential control buttons.

## Features

- Stopwatch displays **hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds**.
- Essential buttons: **Start, Stop, Reset**.
- Live time updates with millisecond precision.
- **Responsive design** using Bootstrap to ensure the stopwatch works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Clean and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML5**: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling the stopwatch layout and ensuring responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to handle the start, stop, and reset functionality.
- **Bootstrap**: To enhance the design and ensure responsiveness.

### Backend:
- **Django 5.0**: Web framework for handling the backend logic and routing.

## How It Works

1. The stopwatch features three buttons: **Start**, **Stop**, and **Reset**.
2. When the **Start** button is pressed, the stopwatch begins tracking the time, updating every millisecond.
3. The **Stop** button pauses the timer without resetting the time.
4. Pressing **Reset** clears the time back to zero.
5. The time is displayed in a neat and organized format, with black background and red digits for clear visibility.
